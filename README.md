ecu-tool
========

Tool to communicate with vehicle ECUs based on Arduino

Github repo for the tool presented at Blackhat Arsenal USA and Defcon 21 in Las Vegas on 2013 on the talk "Dude, WTF in my car!"

The code for the portable version will be released when a few bugs are corrected, but it shouldnt take long ;)

I will be adding info to the wiki soon aswell!

Feel free to email me with code requests (at your own risk!)
