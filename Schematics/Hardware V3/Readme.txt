HW V3 holds all the required components in one PCB, making it smaller and easier to assemble. It has CAN and K-LINE interfaces.

Also, a small PCB with the buttons has been added.

The ZIP files contain the Gerber files to order your own ECU tool PCBs from OSHPark, which is one of the cheapest PCB manufacturers, or you can try  http://smart-prototyping.com/ too! (Thanks Jan LÃ¼ke!)

So just upload the files to any of those site and enjoy!
